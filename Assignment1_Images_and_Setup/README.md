      <td align="left">Can you handle PPMs that have comments in them? Does your parser work with PPMs with only one value on a line, or can it also parse multiple RGB values on a line without breaking the parser?</td>

* Core is the material everyone can get through. I expect everyone to complete this. Coming to class, listening to lectures, and reviewing materials should be sufficient.
* Intermediate is a little more difficult. Very likely you will have to utilize office hours, piazza, etc.
* Advanced is more challenging. You will have to spend more time and very likely use outside materials. I do not expect everyone to complete the advanced section.
