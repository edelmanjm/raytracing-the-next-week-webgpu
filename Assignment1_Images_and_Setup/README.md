# Your Information

*TODO*: Please edit the following information in your assignment

* Name: Jonathan Edelman
* How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
  * Way too many (maybe 15?), thanks to the pain of setting up TypeScript + Webpack + Node. It also looks like I'm going to need a separate browser-oriented portion for the WebGPU part, so that'll be fun.   
* Did you collaborate or share ideas with any other students/TAs/Professors?
  * No, although I probably should've worked with someone who's better with webdev to avoid the setup pain.
* Did you use any external resources? 
  * I consulted various docs and StackOverflow, but didn't reuse of copy any code.
* (Optional) What was the most interesting part of the assignment? How would you improve this assignment?
  * Figuring out my workflow and language features was interesting, if often infuriating 
  * Although command lines and arbitrary file reads are easy in most languages, they're virtually impossible in a browser. Replacing command line/file path with just "some method of running + some way of reading a file" would've made things much easier for me and allowed me to run exclusively in a browser rather than Node and a browser.

    <tr>
      <td>Part 2 - 30% (Core)</td>
      <td align="left">Core - Does your code compile, use good programming style, etc. Did you provide me a trivial way to compile or otherwise run your code?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Part 2 - 60% (Intermediate)</td>
      <td align="left">Does your darken and lighten filter work? Can you save as a P3 or P6 ppm and open it up in a program like GIMP? Can you handle PPMs of any valid dimension?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Part 2 - 10% (Advanced)</td>
      <td align="left">Can you handle PPMs that have comments in them? Does your parser work with PPMs with only one value on a line, or can it also parse multiple RGB values on a line without breaking the parser?</td>
    </tr>

* Core is the material everyone can get through. I expect everyone to complete this. Coming to class, listening to lectures, and reviewing materials should be sufficient.
* Intermediate is a little more difficult. Very likely you will have to utilize office hours, piazza, etc.
* Advanced is more challenging. You will have to spend more time and very likely use outside materials. I do not expect everyone to complete the advanced section.
