* Name: Jonathan Edelman
* How many hours did it take you to complete this final project?
  * Approximately 45, though this is fairly rough since lots of this was optimizations that occurred between assignments 5 and the final.
* Did you collaborate or share ideas with any other students/TAs/Professors?
  * No.
* Did you use any external resources?
  * Shirley's Ray Tracing: The Next Week served as the primary reference
  * I talked with some people on the WebGPU Matrix server regarding optimization and debugging of aspects of my compute shader.
* (Optional) What was the most interesting part of the Final Assignment? How could the instructor improve the final project?
  * Tweaking the performance to make it work reasonably well. No suggestions on improvements.
